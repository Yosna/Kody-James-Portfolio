# Elden Ring Death Counter [![Release v1.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/release-v1.0.0-blue)](https://github.com/Yosna/Elden-Ring-Death-Counter/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

A transparent on-screen death counter for Elden Ring. It reads your characterâ€™s stats from memory to display your death count in the bottom right corner. Disables EAC if necessary. Built using [AutoHotkey v2](https://autohotkey.com).

## Features

- **On-screen overlay:** displays your deaths in the bottom right corner above your runes
- **Toggle key (F8):** show and hide the overlay as needed
- **Manual overwrite:** set a custom death count
- **Multi-character support:** tracks characters by stats instead of save file structure, allowing custom death counts to persist across different save states
- **EAC detection & bypass:** adjusts the environment automatically to prevent Easy Anti-Cheat from running
- **Separate GUI window:** view your character's stats and modify their death count
