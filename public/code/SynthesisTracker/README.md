# FFXI Synthesis Tracker

Tracks synthesis information for items crafted, materials used, material loss rates, total costs, gil earned or lost per item, and overall profit.

## Features

- **Synthesis Tracking:** Tracks and displays total synthesis attempts, breaks, normal quality (NQ), and high-quality (HQ1-3) results.
- **Materials Tracking:** Shows the materials used or lost, along with both the total and their individual costs.
- **Gil Calculations:** Set the item and material costs prior to crafting, and the total gil earned / spent will update in real-time during the crafting session.
- **Auto-Export Results:** Synthesis results are exported to a log file when cleared to keep a record of your lifetime success rates and profits for each crafted item.
- **In-Game Logs:** Read previously exported results in-game.

## How To Use

- [Download ZIP](https://github.com/Yosna/FFXI-Synthesis-Tracker/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract the **SynthesisTracker** folder to `\Windower\Addons`.
- If you're unable to locate your Windower folder, right click `Windower.exe` and select *Open file location*.
- Type `//lua l synthesistracker` or `//lua load synthesistracker` into the game's chat, or into the Windower console if you omit the `//`.
- Alternatively, navigate to `init.txt` located in `\Windower\Scripts` and add `lua load synthesistracker` at the bottom. Save the `.txt` file and then type `//reload` in the game's chat, or `reload` into the Windower console. The addon will now load automatically every time Windower is initialized.

## Addon Commands - `//st <command>`

- **`//st <on / start>`:** Enable synthesis tracking (enabled by default).
- **`//st <off / stop>`:** Disable synthesis tracking.
- **`//st <clear / c>`:** Clear tracked synthesis results (and export results if auto-export is enabled).
- **`//st <export / e>`:** Export tracked synthesis results.
  - **Note:** Results are exported to `windower\addons\SynthesisTracker\Results\<Character>\<Item>\YYYY-MM-DD.log`
- **`//st <autoexport>`:** Toggles auto-exporting for your tracked synthesis information (enabled by default)
- **`//st <cost>`:** Set the cost of an item or material for gil tracking. 
  - **Arguments:** 
    - `//st <cost> <item name> <item cost> <cost divisor (optional)>`
