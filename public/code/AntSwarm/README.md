# Ant Swarm (Text-Based Incremental Game)

**Ant Swarm** is a text-based incremental game written in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The goal was to build a live, fully functional idle game. The deployed version includes an upgrade system, tooltip-based UI, save/load persistence, modal handling, and dynamic game logic â€” intentionally written from scratch without the use of external frameworks such as React or Vue.

## Features

- Modular JavaScript architecture
- Functional save/load system (copy to clipboard + file export/import)
- Upgrade buttons with tooltips, cost scaling, and visual states
- Settings and stat menus with exclusive modal handling
- Offline progression tracking
- Dynamic production logic
- Fully deployable via GitHub Pages

## Status

Many systems are functional such as the core game loop and upgrade mechanics, but not all systems have been finished. A deeper progression system was planned out but wasn't fully implemented. There was a greater focus on interactivity between elements and dynamic rendering than there was on deep progression.
However, the current version is stable, interactable, and demonstrates an understanding of front-end programming without using a framework.
