# Programming Project Portfolio

This is my personal programming portfolio, built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It showcases a collection of my favorite projects, including AI language models, game overlays, and creative tools.

## Website

You can view the portfolio [here](https://yosna.github.io/Kody-James-Portfolio/)—deployed live through GitHub Pages.

## Built With

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
